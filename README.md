## Introduction  
Evidence of global heating has been accumulating over the past three decades and it is now widely accepted that the climate is undergoing a rapid change.  In Australia the major impacts of global heating include increased occurances of heat waves, changes to the rainfall patterns, and increased occurances of days where the weather enhances bush fires.  

## Data  
The data were downloaded from [Climate Change in Australia](https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/obtain-data/download-datasets/) which is a collaboration between the CSIRO and the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology.
