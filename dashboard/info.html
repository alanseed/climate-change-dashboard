            <p class='card-text'>
              The future climate depends on the quantity of greenhouse
              gasses that will have been emitted by the human society using fossil
              fuels as a source of energy since the start of the industrial
              revolution. Since this level depends on how society responds
              globally to limiting the use of fossil fuels to reduce the change
              in the climate, the future state of the climate is represented as
              scenarios, known as

            <p class='card-text'>
              The impact of the change in greenhouse gas concentration on the
              climate is quantified using sophisticated Global Climate Models on
              some of the largest super computers in the world to solve the
              differential equations that govern the state of the atmosphere
              over the globe and for 100 years into the future. The Global
              Climate Models are not perfect representations of the processes
              that drive our climate and the United Nations runs the
              <a href='https://www.ipcc.ch/'>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
                Change</a>
              to assess the results from about 50 models that have been used to
              model a range of scenarios. The data used in this dashboard is
              based on the results from set of 8 models that have been further
              processed to increase their resolution over Australia.

              The likely climate for the various scenarios is given as a range,
              rather than as a single number, due to this uncertainty in the
              modelling.

            <p class='card-text'>
              Uncontrolled bushfires have been a part of the Australian experience for thousands of years due to the dry climate and the combustible eucalypt forests.  The intensity of a fire depends on the fuel (amount, and dryness) that is available and the weather (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) at the time of the fire. The amount of fuel on the forest floor will increase during wet years, and then dry out during a prolonged drought, so the risk of uncontrolled bushfires will likely change as the temperature increases and the rainfall patterns change.

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McArthur_Forest_Fire_Danger_Index">The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI)</a> combines the past rainfall and evaporation with temperature, humidity, and windspeed to provide a summary index of the risk that is presented by a bushfire should one ignite.
